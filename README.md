# Plagarism-Detector

This project contains a plagarism detector that I created for a computer science class at Tufts Univeristy.The detector will sense similarities in different files as well as similatiries in a single file. The repository also contains a simple image attribute program. The program, brightness.c, detects the average brightness of an image. Both of these programs utilize the Hanson data structure library.
